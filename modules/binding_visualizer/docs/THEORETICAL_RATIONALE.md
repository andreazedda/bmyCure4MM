# Theoretical Rationale

The **Binding Visualizer** module provides a way to explore ligand binding interactions in a protein structure using an interactive 3‑D viewer. Visual inspection of binding sites and nearby residues helps researchers reason about structure‑activity relationships. When studying multiple myeloma therapeutics, being able to examine where a drug fits within the proteasome or other targets can suggest mutation impacts, potential resistance mechanisms and opportunities for derivative design.

In drug discovery theory, visualisation tools allow confirmation of docking results and highlight key interactions such as hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic pockets. They support hypothesis generation when altering a ligand or modifying a binding site. This module couples PDB data retrieval with a web‑based viewer, simplifying the workflow from obtaining a structure to analysing it interactively. Because the rendering is browser‑based, results can be shared and reproduced easily.
