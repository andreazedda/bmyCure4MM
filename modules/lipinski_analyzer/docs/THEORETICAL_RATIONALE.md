# Theoretical Rationale

The **Lipinski Analyzer** module calculates basic physicochemical descriptors to evaluate whether a compound obeys Lipinski's Rule of Five, a widely used heuristic for oral bioavailability. In theoretical drug development, these descriptors—molecular weight, LogP, and counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors—help identify molecules with favourable absorption and distribution properties.

Automating these calculations against structures retrieved from PubChem allows researchers to quickly screen many candidate drugs. Compounds that violate several Lipinski criteria often fail in clinical testing due to poor pharmacokinetics. By filtering early, this module supports prioritising ligands with a better chance of success in downstream optimisation and biological assays.
